      ************* Debian Lenny Aug 2009 ********************

A standard install does not provide a working C compiler so 
when a Linrad install is attempted, the first run of the 
configure script would look like this:

deb:/home/dsp# ./configure
checking for /usr/lib/oss/soundcard.h... no
.
.
.
checking for gcc... no
checking for cc... no
checking for cl.exe... no
configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
See onfig.log' for more details.
deb:/home/dsp# 

Fix this by installing gcc and libraries like this:
sudo apt-get install gcc

When running ./configure after having installed gcc one would
get the following last lines:

You might consider installing ALSA
You might consider installing ALSA headers
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... no
The package nasm seems to be not installed.
deb:/home/dsp# 

It is necessary to install nasm:
sudo apt-get install nasm

If you are not going to use the sound system OSS from 4Front
it is a good idea to install the package that allows native ALSA.
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev

With these three packages the configure script ends without errors.
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: creating conf.h
config.status: creating lconf.h
config.status: creating rusage.h
config.status: creating ft245.c
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... yes
Normal End

The command "make" is not available unless it is installed:
sudo apt-get install make

Trying "make xlinrad" now gives this result:
deb:/home/dsp# make xlinrad
 
	To compile for X11 you must install
	the X11 development package and run configure again.
 Debian, Ubuntu,...: apt-get install libX11-dev
 Fedora: yum install libX11-devel
 Mandriva, package libx11_6-devel
 
deb:/home/dsp# 

Do as suggested:
sudo apt-get install libX11-dev
and run ./configure again.

Now make xlinrad will produce the executable without errors.

When setting up the hardware related parameters you will now
se the following message unless you select to start in
"newcomer mode"

*******************************************************************************
The libraries for MIT-SHM are not installed.
Debian: Install the packages libxext-dev and x11proto-xext-dev
Fedora: Install the package libXext-devel[.i586])
Then run ./configure and after that make xlinrad. Finally enable
MIT-SHM in the 'S=Global parms set up' in the main menu of Linrad.
*******************************************************************************

With the Aug 2009 version of Debian Lenny it is enough to
install like this:
sudo apt-get install libxext-dev

It is necessary to run "./configure" and "make xlibnrad" again.

The above is intended to give an idea what the different packages do
and how the Linrad install procedure tries to help. The information
might be helpful under other distributions.

To make it simple, just issue the following sequence of
commands in a console window under X11:
sudo apt-get install gcc
sudo apt-get install nasm
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
sudo apt-get install make
sudo apt-get install libxext-dev
./configure
make xlinrad
./xlinrad
