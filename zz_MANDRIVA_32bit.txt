      ************* Mandriva 2009.0 (64 bit) ********************

The default Mandriva installation does not include compilers
so when a Linrad install is attempted, the first run of the 
configure script would look like this:

[bsz@localhost ~]$ cd test
[bsz@localhost test]$ ./configure
checking for /usr/lib/oss/soundcard.h... no
.
.
.
checking for gcc... no
checking for cc... no
checking for cl.exe... no
configure: error: in /home/bsz/test':
configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
See onfig.log' for more details.
[bsz@localhost test]$ 

Use the software updater and install the meta package task-C-devel
In the choice between glibc-devel and uClibc-devel, select
the default glibc-devel.

The default for libstdc++ is devel-4.3.2-3mnb2.i586 so that
is what I have tested.
It follows that gcc-4.3.2 should also be selected.

The next run of ./configure would end like this:
You might consider installing ALSA
You might consider installing ALSA headers
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... no
The package nasm seems to be not installed.
[bsz@localhost test]$ 

To use ALSA you have to install the development package libalsa2-devel

Installing nasm is necessary:
yum install nasm

Now the configure script ends without errors:
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: creating conf.h
config.status: creating lconf.h
config.status: creating rusage.h
config.status: creating ft245.c
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... yes
Normal End
[bsz@localhost test]$ 

When you now try to compile xlinrad the result is like this:
[bsz@localhost test]$ make xlinrad
 
	To compile for X11 you must install
	the X11 development package and run configure again.
 Debian, Ubuntu,...: apt-get install libX11-dev
 Fedora: yum install libX11-devel
 Mandriva, package libx11_6-devel 
[bsz@localhost test]$ 
joe Makefile.in

 
After installing libX11_6-devel and running ./configure an attempt to
run make xlinrad gives this result: 


The next attempt to run make xlinrad will look like this:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXext
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [xlinrad] Error 1
[bsz@localhost test]$ 

The file libX11.so for 32 bits is installed with the package
libxorg-x11-devel

That is all what is necessary. make xlinrad now compiles
without errors.
