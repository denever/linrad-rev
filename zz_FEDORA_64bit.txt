      ************* Fedora 11 (64 bit) ********************

A Fedora user did presumably not set up his system for software
development so when a Linrad install is attempted, the first
run of the configure script would look like this:


[root@Fd11-64 dsp]# ./configure
checking for /usr/lib/oss/soundcard.h... no
.
.
.
checking for gcc... no
checking for cc... no
checking for cl.exe... no
configure: error: in /home/dsp':
configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
See onfig.log' for more details.
[root@Fd11-64 dsp]# 

Make sure you have Internet access and type:
yum install gcc

Also type:
yum groupinstall "Legacy Software Development"

The next run of ./configure would end like this:
You might consider installing ALSA
You might consider installing ALSA headers
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... no
The package nasm seems to be not installed.
[root@Fd11-64 dsp]# 

To use ALSA you have to install the development package:
yum install alsa-lib-devel.i586
The alsa package is automatically installed by this command since
the development package depends on it.

Installing nasm is necessary:
yum install nasm

Now the configure script ends without errors:
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: creating conf.h
config.status: creating lconf.h
config.status: creating rusage.h
config.status: creating ft245.c
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... yes
Normal End
[root@Fd11-64 dsp]# 

When you now try to compile xlinrad the result is like this:
[root@Fd11-64 dsp]# make xlinrad
 
	To compile for X11 you must install
	the X11 development package and run configure again.
 Debian, Ubuntu,...: apt-get install libX11-dev
 Fedora: yum install libX11-devel
 
After installing libX11-devel and running ./configure an attempt to
run make xlinrad gives this result: 

gcc -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 xmain.c -g -O -DOSNUM=1 -W -Wall -Wimplicit
-Wreturn-type -Wformat -m32 -Wunused -Wcomment -Wchar-subscripts -Wshadow
- -Wuninitialized -Wparentheses -Wstrict-prototypes -Werror -ffast-math
- - -Wundef -fomit-frame-pointer -c -o xmain.ol
In file included from /usr/include/features.h:376,
                 from /usr/include/stdio.h:28,
                 from xmain.c:5:
/usr/include/gnu/stubs.h:7:27: error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file or
directory
make: *** [xmain.ol] Error 1
[root@Fd11-64 dsp]# 

Use yum like this to find out what to install:
yum provides "*gnu/stubs-32.h"

The result would be (july 2009)
updates/filelists_db                                     | 5.0 MB     00:24     
glibc-devel-2.10.1-2.i586 : Object files for development using standard C
                          : libraries.
Repo        : fedora
Matched from:
Filename    : /usr/include/gnu/stubs-32.h

This way we can find out that the next command should be:

yum install glibc-devel.i586

The next attempt to run make xlinrad will look like this:
/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib64/libX11.so when searching for
/ -lX11
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lX11
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [xlinrad] Error 1

The file libX11.so for 32 bits is installed like this:
yum install libX11-devel.i586
 
That is all what is necessary. make xlinrad now compiles
without errors.

When you get into the setup routine you might encounter this
message:

The libraries for MIT-SHM are not installed.
Install the Debian packages libxext-dev and x11proto-xext-dev
Fedora: libXext-devel(.i586)
to enable MIT-SHM.

You can install shared memory for the screen like this:
yum install libXext-devel.i586

This will allow you to select SHM and get a much faster display.
