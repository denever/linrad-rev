      ************* Ubuntu 9.04 ********************

A standard install does provide a working C compiler, but nasm
is not installed so when a Linrad install is attempted, the first
run of the configure script would look like this:

bsz@Ubu904:~/test$ ./configure
checking for /usr/lib/oss/soundcard.h... no
.
.
.
You might consider installing ALSA
You might consider installing ALSA headers
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... no
The package nasm seems to be not installed.
bsz@Ubu904:~/test$ ls z*

Make sure you have Internet access and type:
sudo apt-get install nasm

Linrad requires the 32 bit C compiler so you must also install 
the gcc 32 bit packages:
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
sudo apt-get install lib32asound2-dev

That is enough for xlinrad to compile. In case you want to
use 4Front OSS it might be different, the configure script
might not work properly so it might be necessary to change
Makefile and lconf.h manually.

When you get into the setup routine you might encounter this
message:

The libraries for MIT-SHM are not installed.
Install the Debian packages libxext-dev and x11proto-xext-dev
Fedora: libXext-devel(.i586)
to enable MIT-SHM.

You can install shared memory for the screen like this:
sudo apt-get install x11proto-xext-dev

This will allow you to select SHM and get a much faster display.
