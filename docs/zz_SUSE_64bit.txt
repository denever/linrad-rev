      ************* openSUSE 11.1 ********************

A standard install does not include development or 32 bit environment.
It is recommended to select all necessary packages at installation
time, but if you have a working installation, then use YaST to add the
following packages (or make sure they are already installed)

gcc-32bit
nasm
xorg-x11-devel-32bit
alsa-devel
alsa-tools
alsa-tools-gui
alsamixergui

The configure script looks for libasound.so
For some reason it is not automatically in place.
Create it with a link like this:
sudo ln /usr/lib/libasound.so.2 /usr/lib/libasound.so

A link is also needed for libX11 and libXext:
sudo ln /usr/lib/libX11.so.6 /usr/lib/libX11.so
sudo ln /usr/lib/libXext.so.6 /usr/lib/libXext.so

That is enough for xlinrad to compile. In case you want to
use 4Front OSS it might be different, the configure script
might not work properly so it might be necessary to change
Makefile and lconf.h manually.

Now, run configure with the command ./configure in the Linrad
directory from a terminal window.It should execute without errors
and end like this:

configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: creating conf.h
config.status: creating lconf.h
config.status: creating rusage.h
config.status: creating ft245.c
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... yes
Normal End

Then type the command make xlinrad which should run without errors
and end like this:

cwspeed.ol sdrvar.ol sdr14.ol keyboard_var.ol thrvar.ol \
xsys.ol screen.ol cwdetect.ol tx_graph.ol txssb.ol \
txvar.ol screensub.ol fft3.ol wxsys.ol meter_graph.ol
