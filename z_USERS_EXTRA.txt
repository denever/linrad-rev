The user may add a file: users_extra.c to have his own
additional functions added in a version independent way.

The distribution packages of Linrad contain a file extra.c
which is intended as a prototype.

After you have renamed extra.c to users_extra.c you have
to run the configure script to update Makefile and conf.h

Just copy your users_extra into any new Linrad version 
before running configure to include your own things in 
the new package
