      ************* Ubuntu 9.04 ********************

A standard install does provide a working C compiler, but nasm
is not installed so when a Linrad install is attempted, the first
run of the configure script would look like this:

bsz@Ubu904:~/test$ ./configure
checking for /usr/lib/oss/soundcard.h... no
.
.
.
You might consider installing ALSA
You might consider installing ALSA headers
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... no
The package nasm seems to be not installed.
bsz@Ubu904:~/test$ ls z*

Make sure you have Internet access and type:
sudo apt-get install nasm

It will be a good idea to install ALSA as suggested, but not
if you have installed 4Front OSS. In Ubuntu there is presumably
an OSS compatible interface to ALSA which will be used if you 
do not install the ALSA development package.

When you now try to compile xlinrad the result is like this:
bsz@Ubu904:~/test$ make xlinrad 
 
	To compile for X11 you must install
	the X11 development package and run configure again.
 Debian, Ubuntu,...: apt-get install libX11-dev
 Fedora: yum install libX11-devel
 
bsz@Ubu904:~/test$ 

The command is:
sudo apt-get install libX11-dev


This is all needed to compile Linrad. It will give sound in the
OSS compatibility mode and it will give graphics through the X11
server.

The "S=Global parameters set up." in Linrad will show this message
if you are not in newcomers mode:

*******************************************************************************
The libraries for MIT-SHM are not installed.
Install the Debian packages libxext-dev and x11proto-xext-dev
(Fedora: libXext-devel[.i586])
to enable MIT-SHM.
Then run ./configure and after that make xlinrad.
*******************************************************************************

This will allow graphics through shared memory which bypasses the X11
server and provides moch faster graphics. Like this:

sudo apt-get install x11proto-xext-dev
sudo apt-get install libxext-dev
./configure
make xlinrad

If you want to use 4Front OSS, do not install ALSA.

Ubuntu already has most of ALSA so if you do not remove anything
(by installing OSS)you need only install this package:

sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev

Then, as always after an environment change:
./configure
make xlinrad
