      ************* Fedora 11 (32 bit) ********************

A Fedora user did presumably not set up his system for software
development so when a Linrad install is attempted, the first
run of the configure script would look like this:


[root@F[root@P4FD11 linrad-03.07]# ./configure
checking for /usr/lib/oss/soundcard.h... no
.
.
.
checking for gcc... no
checking for cc... no
checking for cl.exe... no
configure: error: in /home/dsp':
configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
See onfig.log' for more details.
[root@P4FD11 linrad-03.07]# 

Make sure you have Internet access and type:
yum install gcc

The next run of ./configure would end like this:
You might consider installing ALSA
You might consider installing ALSA headers
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... no
The package nasm seems to be not installed.
[root@P4FD11 linrad-03.07]# 

To use ALSA you have to install the development package:
yum install alsa-lib-devel

Installing nasm is necessary:
yum install nasm

Now the configure script ends without errors:
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: creating conf.h
config.status: creating lconf.h
config.status: creating rusage.h
config.status: creating ft245.c
checking for /usr/bin/nasm... yes
Normal End
[root@P4FD11 linrad-03.07]# 

When you now try to compile xlinrad the result is like this:
[root@P4FD11 linrad-03.07]# make xlinrad
 
	To compile for X11 you must install
	the X11 development package and run configure again.
 Debian, Ubuntu,...: apt-get install libX11-dev
 Fedora: yum install libX11-devel
 
That is all what is necessary. make xlinrad now compiles
without errors.

When you get into the setup routine you might encounter this
message:

The libraries for MIT-SHM are not installed.
Install the Debian packages libxext-dev and x11proto-xext-dev
Fedora: libXext-devel(.i586)
to enable MIT-SHM.

You can install shared memory for the screen like this:
yum install libXext-devel

This will allow you to select SHM and get a much faster display. 

To compile the driver for SDR-14 and SDR-IQ you have to install
kernel devel for the kernel you are running. To find out, type
uname -r
[root@P4FD11 linrad-03.07]# uname -r
2.6.29.4-167.fc11.i586

Then install:
yum install kernel-devel-2.6.29.4-167.fc11

or perhaps:
yum install kernel-devel-2.6.30.5-43.fc11

or whatever kernel you are running under.
